\title{Find the junctions that share a same annotated splice sites with the query novel junctions}
\usage{
findBackGroundJunc(
  junc_file,
  junc_anno,
  output_prefix,
  annotation = c("in.ensembl", "in.snaptron"),
  return_value = T
)
}
\arguments{
\item{junc_file}{string or data.frame The output file of mergeJuncData function, which contain junction-sample read counts table. The first four columns should be the coordinates of each junction: "chr", "start", "end", "strand".}

\item{junc_anno}{string or data.frame The output file of annotateJunc function, which contain junction annotations.}

\item{output_prefix}{string Prefix of output PSI file. The junction-sample PSI table will be written in a prefix_norm.txt.gz file.}

\item{annotation}{vector Annotation sources (should in colnames in junc_anno) that were combined to determine novel junction. A junction not annotated in any given source is treated as novel junction. Default: c("in.ensembl", "in.snaptron")}
}
\value{
data.frame Seven-column dataframe. Contain coordinates, mapped gene, and splicing event of each novel junction.
