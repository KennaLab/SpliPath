Description: SpliPath was developed to nominate novel pathogenic mutation hotspots in genomewide by paried DNA sequencing and RNA splicing data analysis. SpliPath provide genomewide splice junction annotation, mutation hotspots nomination, and Shiny-based interactive data visualization, which can be applied to analyse any dataset that includes matched whole genome sequencing and RNAseq data for a common set of donors expected to harbour pathogenic splice-altering rare variants (sRV).
